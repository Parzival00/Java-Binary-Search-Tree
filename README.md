# Java-Binary-Search-Tree

This repository comes from an asssignment I did in my data structures class in school. 
In this class we used Java to learn how to code and implement many different data structures.
This assignment involves creating a binary tree and displaying if it is a BST, the depth, max value, sum of all vaues, average of all values, and if the tree is balanced.
